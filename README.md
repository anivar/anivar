**Head of Engineering @ Foodhub | Open Source Architect | Standards Contributor**

Building resilient infrastructure at global scale, informed by decades in the trenches of FOSS and digital rights.

---

I lead engineering at **Foodhub**, orchestrating the technology that powers restaurant commerce across five countries. My approach is shaped by an uncommon journey: from coordinating the Free Software Foundation of India to architecting enterprise FinTech transformations.

This foundation in public-interest technology provides what I call **"adversarial insight"**—the ability to build systems that are not just functional, but fundamentally resilient, open, and trustworthy.

### Core Focus

*   **🏗️ Global Commerce Infrastructure:** Evolving ordering, payments, and loyalty systems for multi-region scale and high reliability.
*   **🔄 Enterprise Transformation:** Leading the shift from monolithic architectures to event-driven, API-first platforms. Previously led this transformation in regulated FinTech and quick commerce.
*   **🌐 Standards & Protocols:** Active contributor to JavaScript standards (ES2024+) and AI protocol interoperability (Mozilla AI, Linux Foundation).
*   **👥 Engineering Leadership:** Fostering engineering cultures that deliver at velocity without sacrificing governance. Mentored 100+ developers through Google Summer of Code.

### A Career in Open Source

My engineering philosophy is rooted in the FOSS movement and has been a consistent thread throughout my career.

*   **Code:** Contributor to **Mozilla Firefox**, **Mozilla AI** (`any-llm`, `any-agent`), and **JavaScript** (via Mozilla Rhino).
*   **Standards:** ICANN Fellow & Neo-Brahmi Panelist, MLCommons Observer.
*   **Governance:** Advisory Board at **Software Freedom Law Centre, India (SFLC.in)**.
*   **Community:** Led foundational initiatives for Indian language computing, bringing technology to millions.

This isn't idealism—it's pragmatism. The most successful enterprise systems I've built share DNA with the open source projects I've contributed to.

### Connect

I believe in building technology that creates both commercial value and public good. Currently focused on the intersection of enterprise scale and open standards.
