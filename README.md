## 🚀 About Me  

I lead engineering at **Foodhub**, orchestrating the technology that powers restaurant commerce across five countries.  
My approach is shaped by an uncommon journey: from coordinating the **Free Software Foundation of India** to architecting enterprise **FinTech** transformations.  

This foundation in public-interest technology provides what I call **"inclusive tech insight"**—the ability to build systems that are not just functional, but fundamentally resilient, open, and trustworthy.
