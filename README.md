**Head of Engineering @ Foodhub | Open Source Architect | Standards Contributor**

Building resilient infrastructure at global scale, informed by decades in the trenches of FOSS and digital rights.

---

I lead engineering at **Foodhub**, orchestrating the technology that powers restaurant commerce across five countries. My approach is shaped by an uncommon journey: from coordinating the Free Software Foundation of India to architecting enterprise FinTech transformations.

This foundation in public-interest technology provides what I call **"adversarial insight"**—the ability to build systems that are not just functional, but fundamentally resilient, open, and trustworthy.

### Core Focus

*   **🏗️ Global Commerce Infrastructure:** Evolving ordering, payments, and loyalty systems for multi-region scale and high reliability.
*   **🔄 Enterprise Transformation:** Leading the shift from monolithic architectures to event-driven, API-first platforms. Previously led this transformation in regulated FinTech and quick commerce.
*   **🌐 Standards & Protocols:** Active contributor to Unicode/ IDNA / ICANN LGR , protocol interoperability
*   **👥 Engineering Leadership:** Fostering engineering cultures that deliver at velocity without sacrificing governance. Mentored developers through Google Summer of Code and Open source Projects

### From Public Interest to Enterprise Scale

My career bridges FOSS leadership with enterprise transformation. This unique foundation drives my approach to building resilient systems.

*   **National Infrastructure:** Led **Government of India (MeiTY)** funded R&D programs for Indian language computing, serving millions of users at national scale. **[🔗](endorsements/ICFOSS-Government-of-Kerala-Endorsement.pdf)**
*   **Standards & Governance:** **ICANN Fellow**, **Mozilla Representative**, and **Software Freedom Law Centre** advisory board member - shaping internet standards and digital rights.
*   **Recognition:** **[Deccan Herald Changemaker 2024](https://www.deccanherald.com/dh-changemakers/towards-a-more-equal-digital-india-2828823)** for pioneering multilingual computing and digital inclusion in India.
*   **Global Speaking:** Occasional speaker at **MozFest**, **RightsCon**, **FOSSASIA**, and international technology forums.
*   **Community Impact:** **Google Summer of Code** mentor across multiple cycles, designed government FOSS training programs.
*   **Enterprise Experience:** Previously **SVP Engineering** in regulated FinTech, leading platform modernization and digital transformation initiatives.

This foundation in open standards and large-scale public infrastructure informs how I architect enterprise systems today.

### Connect

I believe in building technology that creates both commercial value and public good. Currently focused on the intersection of enterprise scale and open standards.
