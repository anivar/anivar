**Head of Engineering @ Foodhub | Open Source Architect | Standards Contributor**

Building resilient infrastructure at global scale, informed by decades in the trenches of FOSS and digital rights.

---

I lead engineering at **Foodhub**, orchestrating the technology that powers restaurant commerce across five countries. My approach is shaped by an uncommon journey: from coordinating the Free Software Foundation of India to architecting enterprise FinTech transformations.

This foundation in public-interest technology provides what I call **"adversarial insight"**—the ability to build systems that are not just functional, but fundamentally resilient, open, and trustworthy.

### Core Focus

*   **🏗️ Global Commerce Infrastructure:** Evolving ordering, payments, and loyalty systems for multi-region scale and high reliability.
*   **🔄 Enterprise Transformation:** Leading the shift from monolithic architectures to event-driven, API-first platforms. Previously led this transformation in regulated FinTech and quick commerce.
*   **🌐 Standards & Protocols:** Active contributor to JavaScript standards (ES2024+) and AI protocol interoperability (Mozilla AI, Linux Foundation).
*   **👥 Engineering Leadership:** Fostering engineering cultures that deliver at velocity without sacrificing governance. Mentored 100+ developers through Google Summer of Code.

### A Career in Open Source

My engineering philosophy is rooted in the FOSS movement and has been a consistent thread throughout my career.

*   **Language Computing:** Built the infrastructure that brought computing to millions of Indian language users - from founding initiatives to national-scale deployment.
*   **Standards & Governance:** **ICANN Fellow**, **Mozilla Representative**, and **Software Freedom Law Centre** board member - shaping internet standards and digital rights.
*   **Community Leadership:** **Google Summer of Code** mentor across multiple cycles, designed government FOSS training programs.

This foundation in open standards and community-driven development informs how I approach enterprise architecture today.

### Connect

I believe in building technology that creates both commercial value and public good. Currently focused on the intersection of enterprise scale and open standards.
